# Output style

## Writing style

- Write technically and concisely.
- Limit adjectives and adverbs.
- State what the code does, not what it might intend to do.
- Remain objective.
- Avoid flattery.
- Provide actionable suggestions.
- Reference specific lines when possible.
- Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.

## Language conventions

- Use British English for all natural language communication, documentation, and code comments.
- Use American English exclusively for:
  a. Variable and function names (e.g., `color`, `initialize`, `center`)
  b. Configuration keys and API parameters
  c. Any identifiers that form part of the code syntax.

## Markdown generation

Apply these conventions when generating Markdown documentation:

- Use `->` instead of Unicode arrows
- Use `...` instead of the ellipsis character
- Use `+`, `|`, `-` for diagrams instead of box-drawing characters
- Prefer lists to Markdown tables for better LLM parsing
